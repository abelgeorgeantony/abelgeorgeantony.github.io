        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                My name is Abel George Antony and I come from the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuttanad" target="_blank"
                    >lowest altitude in India</a
                >. Curiosity drives me down many paths, from the structured
                logic of computer programming to the abstract depths of
                philosophy I've discovered online. I also have a light interest
                in finance; I casually trade in the Indian stock market to get
                rid of the excess cash I have.
                I fell for the Open Source propaganda and now daily drive Debian with
                GNOME(also because it was simple, fun and adventurous than Windows).
                 My curiosity also extends to the hardware whenever I crave to see the
                 insides of my laptop.
