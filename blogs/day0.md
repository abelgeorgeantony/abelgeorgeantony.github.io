# Vamozhi is an Urban Dictionary for Malayalam

So today I was thinking about starting new projects as usual(Because I am still daydreaming about finding an idea that will make me famous). And then I thought, what if I built a dictionary for words that are not formal or words that are commonly used among the people.

i.e., what it means in a normal person to person conversation.

I also planned to add a data/feature to show distinctions between people using the same words. That might be useful when people are arguing over the pronounciation of a word(Have been there, Have done that). That's when I thought about Urban Dictionary. So I thought I would build a similar project but for Malayalam exclusively(also less vulgar).
