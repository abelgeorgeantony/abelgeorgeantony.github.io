title: "Design choice: Scrollbar on the left side! Why?"
---

## This is my attempt to explain why I put the scrollbar on the left side in this site.

You might also ask why I am attempting to explain it...
Becaaaauseee almost all scrollbars are on the right side. So when you visit this site, it is very unintuitive to even find the scrollbar(Even for me). People will move the cursor to the right edge of the browser only to find that the scrollbar is not there, but on the left side.

### Backstory
When I was making this site I felt that the default scrollbar was boring, different in each browser and would degrade the aesthetics. So I decided that I need a custom one, I didn't want to go with a traditional-custom scrollbar. They all look and feel the same. Then I got the idea for a rail like scrollbar. I don't know what inspired me to think of a scrollbar like that. NGL, was a bit difficult to prompt Gemini to design a scrollbar like this. Most probably because no one had implemented/designed one like this(If you know examples of scrollbars like this rail design, please share it with me!).\
After I got a basic version working I just left it as it is on the left edge of the browser. Because I thought I had perfected the scrollbar! Was a bit dissapointed because I had prompted Gemini to have a mountain-peak like effect on the scrollbar which would indicate the scroll-thumb's position. It didn't achieve the effect, I thought. It was actually implemented but it was implemented in the right side of the scrollbar container which is in the right side, which made the effect hidden. I didn't push too hard to look into it as it was just a cosmetic effect.

### Now to why I moved the scrollbar to left
After some days, I was modifying the cursors from the default ones to the apple designed cursors to bring more aesthetics(Was just slacking off on this site, rather than studying for exams). After using the site with the apple cursors, clicking on the scrollbar lines to navigate felt difficult or weird because I couldn't see the cursor clearly(I had added the finger pointing cursor to appear when hovering over a line in the scrollbar). So after a little bit of tinkering to see how to resolve it, I decided to change the scrollbar to the left side. I don't remember how I got that choice. But it was one heck of a decision.\
And now using the scrollbars feel nice with my custom cursors. But people having the intuition/conditioning to look for the scrollbar on the right side, may cost UX and ease of use(If you have the time, share the feedback on how you felt using the scrollbar, not just the scrollbar being on the left but also the custom scrollbar).
